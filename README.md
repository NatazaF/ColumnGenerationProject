# ColumnGenerationProject
 This project is the implementation of column generation based on the paper "Branch and Cut and Price for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows" by Ropke and Cordeau as part of my internship at INRIA.
 
# Requirements
Sagemath 8.6

Python 3

# Notes
The main function of the algorithm in the master_problem.py
The branch and bound module is not complete as it implements only the branching on the number of vehicles strategy.
